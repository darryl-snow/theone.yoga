> As ordinary people, those who are not inclined towards the spiritual aspect can take to Yoga for its physical benefits. Health of the body and the mind is important to all, whether they wish to succeed in their worldly pursuits or in Self-Realization. <br>---- YOGA-A GEM FOR WOMEN by Geeta S. Iyengar
