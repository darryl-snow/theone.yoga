I'll finish my 3 year Iyengar Yoga Teacher Training Course in July 2019. Time have flown quickly. Thinking back over these years, I attended 2 TTCs, one was 200 hour yoga TTC in Rishikesh, India, the other is Iyengar yoga TTC in Shenzhen, China. I also had a few intensive courses and workshops in China and Singapore. I learned lots from these great teachers in how to teach and practice.

It's easy to be a yoga teacher, but it's difficult to be a good or great yoga teacher. It's easy to teach a yoga class, but it's difficult to teach an effective and attractive yoga class.

I'm working on the latter.
